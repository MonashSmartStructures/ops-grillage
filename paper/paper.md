# Summary

`ospgrillage` is a wrapper for `OpenSeesPy` to create bridge grillage models in `OpenSees` - the simulation framework for
structural and geotechnical systems. Before `ospgrillage`, users of `OpenSeesPy` are required to write code from scratch
to define a section or a mesh of nodes for example. Such code can be very length for models such as a bridge grillage model -
having many elements and features to be defined. With `ospgrillage` it is now possible to create a variety of grillage models with 
just a few lines of codes which then wraps and executes the relevant `OpenSeesPy` commands for model
generation. In addition, `ospgrillage` allow users to output an executable python script
containing these relevant `OpenSeesPy` command to create the prescribed grillage model. In addition to model creation,
another big part of `ospgrillage` is its load analysis utility for the created grillage models, offering users the ability to perform
static and moving load analysis. An online documentation has been provided at 
Ngan et. al. (2021) which includes tutorials and examples for `ospgrillage`.


# Statement of Need

`OpenSees` (Open System for Earthquake Engineering) is a software framework allowing users to create finite element application for simulating
responses of structural and geotechnical systems subjected to earthquake [@Mckenna2011]. Recently, its python interpreter `OpenSeesPy` have been made
available [@ZHU20186]. Soon after, `OpenSees` has seen increase usage in wider fields of application especially for research studies. 

One of the fields that has seen increasing application of `OpenSeesPy` is bridge engineering applications. `OpenSeesPy` caters to a wide variety
of bridge modelling techniques; from a simple 1-D line model consisting of linear beam elements (micheal scott) to 
more detailed 3-D () having large number of model elements (JosÃ© Benjumea). Overall, `OpenSeesPy` is very robust when it comes to 
bridge engineering applications.

However, `OpenSeesPy` requires users to write scripts for its usage. A typical script of `OpenSeesPy` commands
consist several domains including the construction (e.g. *node*, and *element* commands), and the analysis domain (e.g. *load* commands). 
Moreover, such scripts can be lengthy when considering a more elaborate bridge model with many elements and nodes. 
In turn, its application can become tedious especially during code modification or during troubleshooting processes. 
Overall, creating bridge models with lengthy `OpenSeesPy` scripts from scratch can be arduous when considering analysis such as
parametric analysis. 

`ospgrillage` was designed to provide a simple interface for creating grillage models using `OpenSeesPy`. `ospgrillage`
offer interface functions which wraps `OpenSeesPy` commands in creating grillage model. For example, a command (create_grillage()) 
automatically generate the model generating commands of `OpenSeesPy` i.e. node(), and element(). `ospgrillage` also automates the domain for 
implementing load cases and analysis to the created grillage models. Overall, these interface feature significantly 
reduces the time required for numerical analysis of bridge grillage models using `OpenSeesPy`.

`ospgrillage` is intended for two groups of users. Firstly, the ability of `ospgrillage` in providing a simple interface for creating grillage
is suited for users who wish to create and analyze grillage models instantaneously in `OpenSees` framework. Secondly, `ospgrillage` has
the ability to generate and export fully-fledged python scripts generates the same grillage model in `OpenSees` framework when executed - good for generating 
multiple model templates. This template creating feature caters for users who wish to create and store multiple grillage models for uses outside of
`ospgrillage`. Overall, having both capabilities to either create model instance or fully-fledged template scripts can open up the software to a wider audience,
lowering the bar for teaching and learning of the `OpenSeesPy` module. 


# Package information

In general, `ospgrillage` wraps `OpenSeesPy` command for:

- creating grillage model, and
- running analysis

Source code, documentation, and issue trackers can be found at `ospgrillage`'s the main repository. Details on the module 
design can be found on the documentation page. Guide and examples for creating grillage models can be found in 
documentation as well.
